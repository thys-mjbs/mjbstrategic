          Operational and financial clarity<br>
          for owner-managed businesses
        </h1>

        <p>
          When cash stays tight, stock absorbs energy, or growth creates pressure,
          the issue is rarely effort or intent. It is usually structural.
        </p>

        <p>
          MJB Strategic produces fixed-scope diagnostic reviews that explain
          what is happening inside a business, why it feels the way it does,
          and where pressure is actually coming from.
        </p>

      <h2>The problem this addresses</h2>
      <p>
        Many owner-managed businesses are operationally active and commercially viable,
        yet remain under constant financial and operational strain.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cash flow feels unpredictable. Inventory ties up capital.
        Margins look acceptable on paper but fail to convert into breathing room.
        Decision-making becomes reactive because the underlying causes are unclear.
      </p>
      <p>
        These symptoms are often treated individually. The structure creating them is not.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION -->
    <section>
      <h2>What this is (and is not)</h2>
      <p>
        This is a diagnostic engagement. It is not advisory, implementation,
        or ongoing consulting.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each engagement produces a written report based on historical data and
        existing operational information. The goal is to surface structural
        pressure points, not to prescribe actions or manage outcomes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Responsibility for decisions and execution remains with the business
        owner and their existing advisors.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION -->
    <section>
      <h2>Who this is for</h2>
      <p>
        This work is designed for owner-managed businesses that are trading,
        growing, and operationally active, but experiencing persistent strain in
        cash flow, working capital, inventory, or margins.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is most useful where the business is “busy but tight” —
        where effort is high, activity is visible, yet relief never quite arrives.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION -->
    <section>
      <h2>What you receive</h2>
      <p>
        A clear, plain-language diagnostic report that explains:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>What is happening inside the business</li>
        <li>Why pressure concentrates where it does</li>
        <li>How operational and financial elements interact</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The output is descriptive, not prescriptive.
        Its value lies in clarity, not instruction.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION -->
    <section>
      <h2>Why this approach</h2>
      <p>
        Most pressure inside a business is structural before it is tactical.
        Until those structures are visible and understood,
        changes tend to move effort around rather than relieve it.
      </p>
      <p>
        A bounded diagnostic creates shared understanding,
        reduces noise, and provides a stable base for better decisions —
        whether changes follow or not.
      </p>
