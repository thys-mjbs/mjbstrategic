        <h1>
          Operational and financial clarity<br>
          for owner-managed businesses
        </h1>

        <p>
          Many businesses are commercially viable, operationally active,
          and led with care yet remain under persistent pressure.
        </p>

        <p>
          Cash never quite settles. Working capital feels tight.
          Growth adds complexity instead of relief.
          Decisions become reactive, not because of poor judgment,
          but because the underlying structure is unclear.
        </p>

        <p>
          MJB Strategic provides fixed-scope diagnostic reviews that
          make those structures visible explaining what is happening,
          why pressure concentrates where it does,
          and how operational and financial elements interact.

      <h2>The problem this addresses</h2>
      <p>
        Persistent strain inside a business is rarely caused by a single issue.
        It emerges from the way cash, inventory, operations, and decision-making
        interact over time.
      </p>
      <p>
        When those interactions are poorly understood,
        effort increases while clarity decreases.
        Activity stays high, but relief never quite arrives.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION -->
    <section>
      <h2>What this is (and is not)</h2>
      <p>
        This is a diagnostic engagement.
        It is not advisory, implementation, or ongoing consulting.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each engagement produces a written report based on historical data
        and existing operational information.
        The purpose is descriptive clarity, not instruction or outcome ownership.
      </p>
      <p>
        Decisions and execution remain with the business owner
        and their existing advisors.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION -->
    <section>
      <h2>Who this is for</h2>
      <p>
        Owner-managed businesses that are trading, growing,
        and operationally engaged,
        yet experience recurring pressure in cash flow,
        working capital, inventory, or margins.
      </p>
      <p>
        Especially where the business feels busy, stretched,
        and dependent on constant attention to stay balanced.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION -->
    <section>
      <h2>What you receive</h2>
      <p>
        A clear, plain-language diagnostic report that explains:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>What is happening inside the business</li>
        <li>Why pressure accumulates where it does</li>
        <li>How operational and financial dynamics reinforce each other</li>
      </ul>
      <p്>
        The value lies in shared understanding,
        not prescriptions or promises.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION -->
    <section>
      <h2>Why this approach</h2>
      <p>
        Structural clarity changes how decisions are made,
        even before any action is taken.
      </p>
      <p>
        By reducing ambiguity,
        a bounded diagnostic creates space for better judgment
        whether changes follow immediately or not.
      </p>
