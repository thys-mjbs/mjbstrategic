      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

      <p>
        MJB Strategic respects your privacy and is committed to handling personal information
        responsibly and transparently. This page explains what information is collected, how it is
        used, and the boundaries that apply.
      </p>

      <h2>Information collected</h2>

      <p>
        Information is collected only when you choose to provide it. This typically occurs when you
        submit a contact form or communicate directly via email.
      </p>

      <p>
        The information collected may include your name, email address, organisation name, and any
        high-level context you choose to share. You are not required to submit sensitive financial,
        personal, or confidential information at the initial contact stage.
      </p>

      <h2>How information is used</h2>

      <p>
        Information provided is used solely to respond to enquiries, assess whether a conversation
        or engagement may be appropriate, and manage communications.
      </p>

      <p>
        Information is not used for advertising, profiling, automated decision-making, or resale.
        MJB Strategic does not operate mailing lists, marketing funnels, or behavioural tracking
        systems.
      </p>

      <h2>Data storage and handling</h2>

      <p>
        Submitted information is stored using standard third-party tools such as Google Forms and
        email services. These platforms apply their own security and privacy practices.
      </p>

      <p>
        Reasonable care is taken to prevent unauthorised access or misuse. However, no internet-based
        system can be guaranteed to be completely secure.
      </p>

      <h2>Third-party services</h2>

      <p>
        This website does not intentionally use tracking cookies, analytics platforms, or advertising
        pixels. Where third-party services are used (for example, Google Forms), data is subject to
        the privacy policies of those providers.
      </p>

      <h2>Information sharing</h2>

      <p>
        Personal information is not sold, rented, or shared with third parties, except where required
        by law or where necessary to operate basic communication tools.
      </p>

      <h2>Retention</h2>

      <p>
        Information is retained only for as long as reasonably necessary to manage communications or
        assess potential work. You may request deletion of your information at any time.
      </p>

      <h2>Your rights</h2>

      <p>
        You may request access to, correction of, or deletion of your personal information by making
        contact via the Contact page.
      </p>

      <h2>Policy updates</h2>

      <p>
        This privacy policy may be updated periodically to reflect changes in practice or regulatory
        expectations. Continued use of the site indicates acceptance of the current version.
