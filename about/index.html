      <h1>About Matthys Creative</h1>
      <p>Matthys Creative exists as a dedicated writing studio focused on the development of original long-form fiction. The studio was created to provide a stable structure for sustained creative work, prioritising narrative depth, consistency, and intent over visibility or output frequency.</p>
      <p>This project is designed to support a body of work that unfolds over time, allowing ideas, themes, and story worlds to be developed with care and continuity.</p>

      <h2>The Author Behind the Studio</h2>
      <p>Matthys Creative is founded and operated by Matthys Benson. While the studio maintains a clear identity of its own, it is shaped by a single creative voice and a deliberate approach to long-form storytelling.</p>
      <p>The work produced here reflects an interest in structure, consequence, and psychological tension, approached with restraint and long-term focus rather than personal exposition.</p>

      <h2>Fiction as the Sole Output</h2>
      <p>All writing produced under Matthys Creative is fictional. The studio’s work is grounded exclusively in narrative construction, character development, and imagined scenarios, with no intent to instruct, advise, or represent real events.</p>
      <p>To date, two thriller novels have been published as part of an ongoing series, with a third book currently in development. These works are distributed through Amazon as the primary publication platform.</p>

      <h2>Focus and Forward Direction</h2>
      <p>Matthys Creative is oriented toward the continued development of cohesive thriller fiction. Each project contributes to a broader body of work, shaped by recurring themes, narrative discipline, and an emphasis on long-form coherence.</p>
      <p>The studio approach allows future writing to evolve naturally, without reliance on external pressures, fixed schedules, or promotional expectations.</p>
