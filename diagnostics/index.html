      <h1>What the diagnostic work covers</h1>
  
      <p>
        Each engagement at MJB Strategic is a fixed-scope diagnostic review of how a business
        is actually behaving beneath the surface. The focus is not on isolated issues, tools,
        or tactics, but on identifying the structural patterns that create recurring pressure,
        confusion, or constraint.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        The specific areas examined depend on the business, its data, and where strain is
        already showing up. The examples below illustrate the type of analysis typically
        performed, rather than a fixed or exhaustive menu of services.
      </p>
  
      <h2>Cash and working capital diagnostics</h2>
  
      <p>
        These reviews focus on understanding why a business can appear profitable yet still
        experience persistent cash pressure. They examine how timing, stock, tax obligations,
        supplier terms, and owner withdrawals interact over time.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        The outcome is a clear explanation of where cash is being absorbed, when pressure
        intensifies, and why growth or increased activity can sometimes make the situation
        feel worse rather than better.
      </p>
  
      <h2>Inventory and product mix diagnostics</h2>
  
      <p>
        These reviews examine how inventory behaves as both an operational asset and a
        financial constraint. The analysis looks at stock movement, capital tied up in
        different product groups, and how reliance on certain items affects cash and margin
        stability.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        The output highlights where capital is quietly trapped, where sales volume masks
        underlying inefficiency, and why inventory decisions can dominate financial outcomes
        even when overall sales appear healthy.
      </p>
  
      <h2>Pricing and margin structure diagnostics</h2>
  
      <p>
        These reviews focus on how gross margin is actually generated across the business,
        rather than relying on averages. They examine margin distribution, volatility, and
        sensitivity to small changes in price, cost, or discounting behaviour.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        The result is a clearer understanding of why profitability can feel fragile, why
        margins erode without obvious triggers, and which parts of the business carry
        disproportionate economic weight.
      </p>
  
      <h2>Reporting and decision-visibility diagnostics</h2>
  
      <p>
        These reviews assess how information flows through the business and where reporting
        structure obscures reality. They identify blind spots, lagging indicators, and
        metrics that create confidence without improving decision quality.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        The outcome is clarity on what the business cannot currently see in time, and why
        decisions often feel reactive, second-guessed, or disconnected from outcomes.
      </p>
  
      <h2>Operational and structural diagnostics</h2>
  
      <p>
        These reviews focus on how operational complexity, process inconsistency, and
        decision concentration translate into financial strain. They connect day-to-day
        friction to measurable outcomes rather than treating operations and finance as
        separate concerns.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        The output explains why the business feels heavier to run than it should, and where
        structure, rather than effort or intent, is limiting performance.
      </p>
  
      <h2>Scope and engagement framing</h2>
  
      <p>
        The examples above reflect the core areas where diagnostic work is most often applied,
        including cash behaviour, inventory dynamics, pricing and margin structure, reporting
        quality, and operational constraints. They illustrate how analysis is used to explain
        pressure and decision friction, not to prescribe actions or implement change.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        In practice, each engagement is shaped around the specific structure and data of the
        business. Most diagnostics are custom in focus, and relevant areas are identified
        based on where pressure is actually emerging rather than from a predefined list.
        If a business situation does not fit neatly into the examples shown, it can be discussed
        directly to determine whether a focused diagnostic review would be appropriate.
